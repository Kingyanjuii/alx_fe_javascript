# Dynamic Quote Generator (Advanced DOM Manipulation)

This project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
It dynamically generates and displays quotes based on categories selected by the user.  
Users can also add new quotes and categories through a form interface, and the content updates instantly without reloading the page.

## Features
- Display a random quote on page load and when the "Show New Quote" button is clicked.
- Filter quotes by category using a dropdown menu.
- Add new quotes and categories dynamically through a form.
- Uses advanced DOM manipulation methods (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `addEventListener`, etc.).
- Stores quotes in memory (can be extended to use `localStorage` for persistence).
